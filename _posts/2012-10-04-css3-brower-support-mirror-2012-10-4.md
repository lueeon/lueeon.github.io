CSS3 is not yet a W3C standard, but all the major browsers are already supporting many of the new features.

Some  new CSS3 properties are widely supported by all the major browsers.So in some times,we can ellipsis prefix,like -webkit-,-o-,-moz- and -ms-.

From the preference,you can quickly find the property you want to use if is supported by some browers,and decide to use necessary prefix.

Here is the [link](/demo/css3_brower_support/index.html) or directly see it below.
